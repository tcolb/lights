# lights

A knock to let your long distance partner or friend know you're thinking of them.



Built using:
- 1x RPI3 (hosting MQTT server)
- 2x RPI0W (knock clients)
- 2x Accelerometers (to detect knocks)
- 2x LED Matix Headers (to display fun graphics... or sad graphics when the other unit can't be reached)

The code is probably bad.
